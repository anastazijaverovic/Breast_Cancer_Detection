# Breast_Cancer_Detection
UCI open source dataset used to detect breast cancer. This breast cancer database was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg

In this project I am building a logistic regression model in order to identify correlations between the following 9 independent variables and the class of the tumor (benign or malignant). Logistic regression can identify important predictors of breast cancer using odds ratios and generate confidence intervals that provide additional information for decision-making. 
Then, I used other classification models to predict the dependent variable: K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Kernel Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest model.

Independent variables:
Clump thickness
Uniformity of cell size
Uniformity of cell shape
Marginal adhesion
Single epithelial cell
Bare Nuclei
Bland chromatin
Normal nucleoli
Mitoses

Model performance depends on the ability of the radiologists to accurately identify findings on mammograms.
